## Quiz App with Gamification
### Project Overview
This is a web-based quiz application built using Next.js that fetches quiz data from an external API and presents it through an engaging user interface. The app includes gamification features such as a timer, progress tracking, and instant feedback on answers. The goal is to make learning interactive and fun for users.

### Key Features
Quiz Flow: Users can start a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and see their results at the end.

## Gamification:

Timer to track quiz duration.

Instant feedback on correct/incorrect answers.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Error Handling: Proper error handling for API requests and user inputs.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher)

npm (v9 or higher)





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
